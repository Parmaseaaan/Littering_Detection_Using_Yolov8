# Littering_Detection_Using_Yolov8
 This code is based on a research study which is a Littering detection algorithm using YOLOv8 the code uses to kinds of spatial algorithms to helps yolo be aware of its surroundings.
 It is based on the research made by (Perilla et, al.,2023) which is uploaded here in the repository
 below is the trained model and the video we used in detecting littering
